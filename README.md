This repo is for Labs and Assignments in Web App Development 2

## Completed Labs

All class labs have been complete up to week 8.

### Assignment 1

Assignment one (extending the app beyond week 8).

I have added a "Top Rated" movies page, displaying the top rated movies from TMDB.

I have also added a "Popular Actors" page to display current popular actors, this was accomplished using the trending people api.

On the "Popular Actors" page, I built cards of the actors, using the movies cards from the labs as a template. Clicking on more info will bring you into the person details page, giving a biography of the actor, some quick info, and what movies they have appeared in.

I also added the cast members to the movie detail page.

I then added a link to the cast members in the movie page, that when you clicked on them, it would bring you to the correct person details page, and then the opposite on the person details page to link you to the movie.

Material ui Carousel has been added for the images on the movie details page to tidy the page up.

Now Playing was also added.

Minor fixes such as spacing, and adding a colour to the movie and actor chips when hovered over
